-   The App component manages the state of product data fetched from an API, cart items, and visibility of the shopping and home page. The Navbar component provides a navigation bar at the top allowing users to navigate between pages
    
-   The ShowProducts component displays the product data and enables users to add products to the cart, a state that is updated dynamically with item counts and total prices

- I used CSS to style the Navbar, sizing, color, and margins for HTML elements.
